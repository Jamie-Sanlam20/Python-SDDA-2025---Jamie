<!-- flex and grid are meant to be used alongside eachother  -->
<!-- with flex, all the columns will be there, we cannot just choose 2 out of the 3 - maintaining no of columns -->

<!-- you can choose how many columns will be in a row with grid -->
<!-- 2D - grid understands that pink box should come right under violet -->
<!-- flex starts from anywhere -->

<!-- width is equal with grid: 1fr 1fr (2 in a column): 1 : 1 : 1 ratio -->
<!-- 3 columns: 1 : 1 : 1 rato - 1fr 1fr 1fr -->
<!-- if you want to increase width of middle one: 1fr 2fr 1fr (doubles middle width)-->
<!-- height remains constant -->

<!-- property: repeat - allows you to repeat columns - repeat(4, 1fr) - repeat 1fr 4 times -->

<!-- grid doesn't maintain the height overall, it maintains row height -->
<!-- gap in grid - space between columns and rows -->
<!--  flex - will either be space between rows or colums (not both) - depends on the direction -->
<!-- if flex wrap is on - both row and column space -->
