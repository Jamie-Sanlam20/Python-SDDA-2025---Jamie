# Variable names

# Syntax Rules - will cause syntax errors
# 1. Avoid keywords
# cannot use if, else, elif, while, is, for -> as variable names
# 2. Don't overwrite built-in functions
# e.g., sum = 2 (sum is already a function)
# 3. Cannot start with number
# e.g., 1t = ❌
# e.g., t1 = ✅
# 4. Cannot use special sign except _
# e.g., num$ = ❌
# e.g., num_1 = ✅

# Good Practice
# 1. Use snake_case for general variable names
# 2. Should be descriptive (but keep it short)
# 3. CONSTANT_CASE (variable should be in capital letters)
# e.g., PI = 3.14 (doesn't change)
