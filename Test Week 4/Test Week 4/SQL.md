1.  Write a query to list all artworks where the title contains 'Night', sorted by title in ascending order.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM artworks
WHERE title LIKE '%Night%'
ORDER BY title;
```

2.  Write a query to display each artist with the total number of artworks they have created, including artists with no artworks, sorted in descending order by the artwork count.

```sql
SELECT artists.name, COUNT(artworks.artwork_id) AS Total_artwork
FROM artists
LEFT JOIN artworks
	ON artists.artist_id = artworks.artist_id
GROUP BY artists.name
ORDER BY Total_artwork DESC;
```

3.  Write a query to display the average price of artworks for each genre, only including genres where the average price is above 800000, sorted by genre name.

```sql
SELECT genre, AVG(price) AS Average_Price
FROM artworks
GROUP BY genre
HAVING AVG(price) > 800000
ORDER BY genre;
```

4.  Write a query to list all artists who do not have any artworks in the artworks table.

```sql
SELECT artists.name
FROM artists
LEFT JOIN artworks
	ON artists.artist_id = artworks.artist_id
WHERE artworks.artwork_id IS NULL;
```
